## Timothy Winn, MD

He's just some guy, ya know? 

### Background

Pediatrician with past lives. Former softare engineer, barista, NICU nurse, EM resident.

### Why does this blog exist? 

One thing I have learned is that I learn by writing. I'd like to revive dormant parts of my brain which once knew mathematics, computer science, and programming. If I could manage that, maybe I could do something useful with it. Maybe. Whether I do or don't, the idea is that I'll write about it here.
